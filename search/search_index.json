The library provides a comprehensive API for automating robot design tasks, including solid model manipulation, robot assembly management, graph-based visualizations, and exporting CAD assemblies to URDF files for simulation and control. Intended as a resource for the robotics community, this library leverages Onshape's REST API to facilitate advanced workflows that bridge CAD design and robotics applications.</p> <p></p> <p>\u00a0 This library was inspired by onshape-to-robot, a tool renowned for its streamlined approach to URDF generation. While onshape-to-robot library focuses on predefined workflows and design-time considerations, the <code>onshape-robotics-toolkit</code> library offers greater flexibility. It provides access to nearly all of Onshape's REST API calls, enabling headless manipulation, detailed analysis, and seamless export of CAD assemblies. Users can programmatically edit variable studios, generate graph-based visualizations, and export URDF files tailored to their specific needs\u2014all without being restricted by rigid workflows or naming conventions. By removing these constraints, the <code>onshape-robotics-toolkit</code> library empowers the robotics and CAD communities to create custom solutions for algorithmic design, optimization, and automation.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"#key-features-of-onshape-robotics-toolkit","title":"Key Features of <code>onshape-robotics-toolkit</code>","text":"<p>The <code>onshape-robotics-toolkit</code> library is designed for users seeking a scalable, versatile API that empowers innovative robot design and control workflows.
