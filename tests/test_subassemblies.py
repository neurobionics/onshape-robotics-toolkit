"""Tests for subassembly data structure and rigid assembly handling."""

# NOTE: These tests are for the old nested assembly structure.
# With the new flat CAD design, subassemblies are flattened into the main registries.
# These tests need to be rewritten for the flat structure.
# For now, they are skipped.
